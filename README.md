This addon adds [DualSenseX](https://dualsensex.com/) support to [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), enabling the integration and use of the advanced features of the [DualSense](https://www.playstation.com/pt-br/accessories/dualsense-wireless-controller/) controller directly in your projects within the engine.
